# Tinder-Bot
A bot to find tinder matches.

The ```bot.py``` file once triggered automatically starts logs into your Tinder account using Facebook and starts finding matches for you.
The username and password are to be specified in a seperate ```secrets.py``` file.

## Requirement
Any system with python 3 (preferably 3.6) and terminal.

## Usage
If you have to just download videos or basically use the script to download videos:
- Navigate to the file directory where the downloaded file (the script file) is stored using the cd command in terminal or cmd.
- Trigger ```python bot.py``` or ```python3 bot.py``` according to the operating system needs.
- Enter the url of the Video Lecture Course that you want to download.

## Known Issue
None as of now. Currently, I'm trying to add a Resume Downloads Feature. Feel free to open an issue if any!
